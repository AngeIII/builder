  // In particular, unlike most other browsers, IE11+Edge on Windows 10 on touch devices and IE Mobile 10-11
  // DON'T remove the click delay when `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">` is present.
  // However, they DO support removing the click delay via `touch-action: manipulation`.
